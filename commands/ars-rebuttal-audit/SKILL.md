description: "ARS academic-paper `rebuttal-audit` mode — QA an existing rebuttal draft against reviewer comments"
disable-model-invocation: true
user-invocable: true

The user invoked `/ars-rebuttal-audit` (port of the Claude Code slash command). First call the `skill` tool with name `academic-paper` to load that skill (unless it is already loaded in this session), then execute the mode it specifies:

Trigger the `academic-paper` skill in `rebuttal-audit` mode. Requires BOTH the reviewer comments AND an existing rebuttal/response draft to evaluate. Produces an advisory QA report (per-comment coverage + gaps + risk flags). Does NOT generate a new response, and does NOT emit Schema 11 / Material Passport / verified status (standalone invocation runs outside the pipeline). Fidelity spectrum, low oversight.

If only reviewer comments are present (no draft yet), use `revision-coach` instead.

Mode reference: `MODE_REGISTRY.md` § academic-paper.
Skill entry: `academic-paper/SKILL.md`.

Note: this command was ported from the ARS Claude Code plugin (Imbad0202/academic-research-skills, CC-BY-NC-4.0). The deterministic tooling it references (scripts/*.py, MODE_REGISTRY.md, shared/) ships in the upstream repo — clone it alongside this plugin if you need script-based features such as the citation verification gate.
